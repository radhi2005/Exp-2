# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To study the problem statement and SRS of a Library Management System and represent its architecture using UML diagrams.
# SRS (Procedure):
```
Analyze the Library Management System and model its components through the following UML diagrams:
1.Use Case Diagram – Identifies actors (e.g., Librarian, Member) and system functionalities (e.g., Search Book, Issue Book, Return Book, Pay Fine).
2.Class Diagram – Represents system classes, attributes, operations, and relationships.
3.Activity Diagram – Describes the dynamic flow of activities such as book issuing and returning.
4.Sequence Diagram – Illustrates object interactions in time sequence for specific processes like book issuance.
5.Communication Diagram – Depicts object collaborations based on interactions.
6.Package Diagram – Organizes classes and components into packages for modular structure.
```
